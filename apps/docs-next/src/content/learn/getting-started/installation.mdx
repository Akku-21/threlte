  three.js and core the library are required. Compose three.js scenes declaratively and state-driven.
- `@threlte/extras`
  <a href="/extras/use-gltf">Components, helpers, hooks and more</a> that extend the core functionality.
- `@threlte/rapier`
  Components and hooks to use the [Rapier physics engine](https://rapier.rs/) in Threlte.
- `@threlte/theatre`

## Configuration

#### Adapt `svelte.config.js`

Add Threlte's preprocessor as well as `'svelte-sequential-preprocessor'` to your Svelte config:

```js lang=js|title=svelte.config.js|copyHighlight{2,3,7-10}
import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess'
import seqPreprocessor from 'svelte-sequential-preprocessor'
import { preprocessThrelte } from '@threlte/preprocess'

const config = {
  // …
  preprocess: seqPreprocessor([preprocess(), preprocessThrelte()])
}

export default config
```

#### Adapt `svelte.config.js`

Add Threlte's preprocessor to your Svelte config:

```js lang=js|title=svelte.config.js|copyHighlight{1,5}
import { preprocessThrelte } from '@threlte/preprocess'

const config = {
  // …
  preprocess: preprocessThrelte()
}

export default config
```

#### Adapt `vite.config.js`

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` and `troika-three-text` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js copyHighlight{3-5}|title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // …
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three', 'troika-three-text']
  }
}
```

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js copyHighlight{3-5}|title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // …
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three']
  }
}
```
