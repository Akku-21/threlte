## Choose the packages you want to use

Threlte consists of 4 packages which can be installed and used individually. `@threlte/core` and Three.js itself are required for all projects while the other packages are optional.

## Configuration

### Adapt `vite.config.js`

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js {3-5} title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // â€¦
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three']
  }
}
```
