- `@threlte/core` and `three` - required
  three.js and core the library are required. Compose three.js scenes declaratively and state-driven.

  <a href="/extras/use-gltf">Components, helpers, hooks and more</a> that extend the core functionality.
- `@threlte/rapier`
  Components and hooks to use the [Rapier physics engine](https://rapier.rs/) in Threlte.
- `@threlte/theatre`
  Components and hooks to use the animation library [Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/) in Threlte.
- `@types/three` - external package
  TypeScript types for three.js.

Install the packages with `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` or any other package manager you prefer.

```bash
npm i -D three @threlte/core @types/three
```

## Configuration

### Adapt `vite.config.js`

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js {3-5} title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // â€¦
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three']
  }
}
```
