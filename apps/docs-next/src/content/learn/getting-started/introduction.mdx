Threlte is a renderer and component library for Svelte to build and render Three.js scenes **declaratively** and **state-driven** in Svelte apps.

It provides strictly typed components to quickly and easily build three.js scenes with deep **reactivity** and **interactivity** out-of-the-box.

[`<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t) is the **main building block** of any Threlte application. It is a thin wrapper around any Three.js
object and provides a declarative API to build and render your Threlte app.

[Plugins](/docs/learn/advanced/plugins) make it easy to extend Threlte with custom code and logic. Whether you want to implement an ECS or add a single property to every instance of `<T>`, plugins are the way to go.

[@threlte/extras](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) is a collection of plugins and components that extend Threlte with additional functionality. It is a great place to start if you want to get a feel for how Threlte works.

<Tip type="experimental">
  Threlte is still in active development and you should expect breaking changes. Check the release
  notes before updating. If you want to be on the safe side, install Threlte with `--save-exact` to
  lock the installed version.
