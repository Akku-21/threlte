# First Scene

Build your first scene:

placeholder.

It should look something like this:

<script lang="ts">
  import GettingStartedPreprocessed from '$examples/getting-started/preprocessed/Scene.svelte'
  import GettingStarted from '$examples/getting-started/Scene.svelte'
</script>

placeholder.

Congratulations :tada:
Orbit around the cube, hover over, [head over to the Playground](/playground/getting-started/playground) and change some values.
