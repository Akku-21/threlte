<Tip type="info">
  You should be versed in both Svelte and Three.js before rushing into Threlte. If you are unsure
  about Svelte, consult its [Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial) for a quick introduction. As for
  Threejs, make sure you at least glance over its [official documentation](https://threejs.org).
</Tip>

## Setup

As a first step we're creating a new Svelte file called `App.svelte` where we are importing the [`<Canvas>` component](/docs/reference/core/canvas).

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<Canvas>
</Canvas>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

The `<Canvas>` component is the root component of your Threlte application. It creates a
renderer and sets up some sensible defaults for you like antialiasing and color management.
It also creates a default camera and provides the context in which your Threlte application
will run, so it's a good idea to wrap your entire application in it.

## Creating Objects

At this point we're looking at a blank screen. Let's add a simple cube to it. We do this by first adding
another Svelte file called `Scene.svelte` and including it in our `App.svelte` file.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="App.svelte" {3,7}+
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

In `Scene.svelte`, we're importing the [`<T>` component](/docs/reference/core/t) which is
the **main building block** of your Threlte application. It's a generic
component that we use to render any Three.js object. In this case we're creating a
[`THREE.Mesh`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) which is made up from
a [`THREE.BoxGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) and
a [`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial).

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We're now looking at a white cube on a transparent background.

### Constructor Arguments

In Three.js objects are classes that are instantiated. These classes can receive one-time constructor
arguments (`new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)`). In Threlte, constructor arguments are always passed as an
array via the prop `args`. If `args` change later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from scratch! Let's make our cube a bit bigger.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {6}m
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This is equivalent to calling `new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 2, 1)`.

## Adding Props

That cube is still a bit boring. Let's add some color to it! We can do this by passing props to the
`<T>` component. In this case we're passing a `color` prop to the `<T.MeshBasicMaterial>` component.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {7}m
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Threlte has some rules of what we can pass as props to `<T>` components. First, it will try to find
the **property on the underlying Three.js object** based on the **name of the prop**. In this case it's the property [`color` on our `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial.color).

It will then look for a method `set` on that property and use it to set the new value. In our example
it will call `material.color.set('hotpink')` to set the color of our material.

If there's no `set` method, it will try to set the property directly.

If there's a `set` method and it accepts more than one value (such as a `THREE.Vector3`: `vec3.set(1, 2, 3)`), we can pass an array as a prop. Let's use this to set the position of our cube.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {5}m
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh position={[0, 1, 0]}>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This is equivalent to calling `mesh.position.set(0, 0.5, 0)`.

### Pierced Props

Because the property `position` of our `THREE.Mesh` is a `THREE.Vector3`, it also has
`x`, `y` and `z` properties which we can set directly via dot-notation, we call this **pierced props**.
Because we left the properties `x` and `z` of the position of our `THREE.Mesh` untouched we can leverage
leverage **pierced props** to only set the `y` position of our cube.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {5}m
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh position.y={1}>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Tip
  type="tip"
  title="Primitive Values"
>
  From a performance perspective, it's often better to use pierced props because
  [primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) prop values can safely be
  compared for equality. This means that if the value of a prop doesn't change, Threlte will skip
  any updates to the underlying Three.js object.
</Tip>

## Events

We're still staring at the side of a cube, let's add a camera and offset it from the center:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {5-8}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[10, 10, 10]}
/>

<T.Mesh position.y={1}>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We're again using the `<T>` component to create a [`THREE.PerspectiveCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera).
We're also passing a `makeDefault` prop which will make this camera the default camera of our application.
The renderer now uses this camera to render our scene.

There's one problem: we're not looking at the direction of the cube, we're pretty much
staring into the void. Threlte supports events on `<T>` components. We can use the `create`
event to get a reference to the underlying Three.js object as soon as it's created and use
the method `lookAt` to look at the cube.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {8-10}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[10, 10, 10]}
  on:create={({ ref }) => {
    ref.lookAt(0, 1, 0)
  }}
/>

<T.Mesh position.y={1}>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Pointer Events

Let's say we want to scale our cube as soon as we hover over it. We first have to import the
[plugin](/docs/learn/advanced/plugins) [`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity) from
[`'@threlte/extras'`](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) and invoke it in our Scene.svelte file:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {3,5}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { interactivity } from '@threlte/extras'

  interactivity()
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[10, 10, 10]}
  on:create={({ ref }) => {
    ref.lookAt(0, 1, 0)
  }}
/>

<T.Mesh position.y={1}>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We can now add interaction event listeners to our `<T>` components. We will add `pointerenter` and
`pointerleave` event listeners to our cube. In the event handlers we'll update the value of a Svelte spring store
and apply the stores value to the property `scale` of the component `<T.Mesh>`.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {4,7,20-22}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { interactivity } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { spring } from 'svelte/motion'

  interactivity()
  const scale = spring(1)
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[10, 10, 10]}
  on:create={({ ref }) => {
    ref.lookAt(0, 1, 0)
  }}
/>

<T.Mesh
  position.y={1}
  scale={$scale}
  on:pointerenter={() => scale.set(1.5)}
  on:pointerleave={() => scale.set(1)}
>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Tip type="tip" title="setScalar">
  You might have noticed that we're only passing a single number to the prop `scale` on `<T.Mesh>`. The component
  `<T>` will first look for a property `setScalar` on	the underlying Three.js object and use that method if
  only a single number is passed. This is equivalent to calling `scale.setScalar($scale)`.
</Tip>

## Finishing Touches

We're almost done. Let's add some shading to our cube and a light source. We'll use a
`THREE.MeshStandardMaterial` on our cube and a `THREE.DirectionalLight` to illuminate our scene.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {27}m {18}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { interactivity } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { spring } from 'svelte/motion'

  interactivity()
  const scale = spring(1)
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[10, 10, 10]}
  on:create={({ ref }) => {
    ref.lookAt(0, 1, 0)
  }}
/>

<T.DirectionalLight position={[3, 10, 7]} />

<T.Mesh
  position.y={1}
  scale={$scale}
  on:pointerenter={() => scale.set(1.5)}
  on:pointerleave={() => scale.set(1)}
>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 2, 1]} />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
</T.Mesh>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Result

Congratulations, you've just created your first Three.js scene with Threlte! It includes important
Three.js and Threlte concepts and should give you a good starting point for your first Threlte project.
