# Context

## What is Context?

Context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Recommended App Structure

The recommended app structure is to implement the component `<Canvas>` that provides all basic contexts and use a single
child component (typically named "Scene.svelte" in examples) for your Threlte app. This way, you don't need to worry about
the presence of contexts in your components.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T, useFrame } from '@threlte/core'
  import Player from './Player.svelte'
  import World from './World.svelte'

  let rotation = 0

  // useFrame is relying on a context provided
  // by <Canvas>. Because we are using a single
  // child component, we don't need to worry
  // about it.
  useFrame((_, delta) => {
    rotation += delta
  })
</script>

<T.Mesh rotation.y={rotation}>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="red" />
</T.Mesh>

<Player />
<World />
```
