## Injecting a Plugin

### What it looks like

Plugins open up the component `<T>` to external code that will be injected via context into every child instance of a `<T>` component.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

injectPlugin('plugin-name', ({ ref, props }) => {
  console.log(ref, props)
})
```

If a plugin decides via `ref` or `props` analysis that it doesn't need to act in the context of a certain `<T>` component, it can return early.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'
import type { Object3D } from 'three'

const refIsObject3D = (ref: any): ref is Object3D => ref.isObject3D

injectPlugin('raycast-plugin', ({ ref, props }) => {
  if (!refIsObject3D(ref) || !props.raycast) return
})
```

The code of a plugin acts as if it would be part of the `<T>` component itself and has access to all properties. A plugin is notified about property or `ref` changes and can run code in lifecycle functions such as `onMount` or `onDestroy`.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'
import { onMount } from 'svelte'

injectPlugin('plugin-name', () => {
  // Use lifecycle hooks as if it would run inside a <T> component.
  onMount(() => {
    console.log('onMount')
  })

  return {
    // This is called when the ref changes and on initialization.
    onRefChange(ref) {
      console.log(ref)

      // You can return a cleanup function that will be called when the ref
      // changes again or when the component is destroyed.
      return () => {
        console.log('cleanup')
      }
    },

    // This is called when the props change and on initialization. This includes
    // props like "args", "manual" and other base props of <T> but also
    // props that are not part of the base props.
    onPropsChange(props) {
      console.log(props)
    },

    // This is called when the props change that are not part of the <T>
    // components base props and on initialization.
    onRestPropsChange(restProps) {
      console.log(restProps)
    }
  }
})
```

It can also _claim properties_ so that the component `<T>` does not act on it.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

injectPlugin('ecs', () => {
  return {
    // without claiming the property "position", <T> would apply the
    // property to the object
    pluginProps: ['entity', 'health', 'velocity', 'position']
  }
})
```

Plugins are passed down by context and can be overridden to prevent the effects of a plugin for a certain tree.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

// this overrides the plugin with the name "plugin-name" for all child components.
injectPlugin('plugin-name', () => {})
```

### Creating a Plugin

Plugins can also be _created_ for external consumption. This creates a _named plugin_. The name is used to identify the plugin and to override it.

```ts
import { createPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

export const layersPlugin = createPlugin('layers', () => {
  // ... Plugin Code
})
```

```ts
// somewhere else, e.g. in a component

import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'
import { layersPlugin } from '$plugins'

injectPlugin(layersPlugin)
```

## Examples

### `lookAt`

This is en example implementation that adds the property `lookAt` to all `<T>` components, so that `<T.Mesh lookAt={[0, 10, 0]} />` is possible:

<Example path="plugins/lookAt" />

### BVH Raycast Plugin

A Plugin that implements [BVH raycasting](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) on all child meshes and geometries.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'
  import type { BufferGeometry, Mesh } from 'three'
  import { computeBoundsTree, disposeBoundsTree, acceleratedRaycast } from 'three-mesh-bvh'

  const isBufferGeometry = (ref: any): ref is BufferGeometry => {
    return ref.isBufferGeometry
  }

  const isMesh = (ref: any): ref is Mesh => {
    return ref.isMesh
  }

  injectPlugin('bvh-raycast', () => {
    return {
      onRefChange(ref) {
        if (isBufferGeometry(ref)) {
          ;(ref as any).computeBoundsTree = computeBoundsTree
          ;(ref as any).disposeBoundsTree = disposeBoundsTree
          ;(ref as any).computeBoundsTree()
        }
        if (isMesh(ref)) {
          ;(ref as any).raycast = acceleratedRaycast
        }
        return () => {
          if (isBufferGeometry(ref)) {
            ;(ref as any).disposeBoundsTree()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
</script>

<slot />
```

Implementing this plugin in your Scene:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import BvhRaycast from './plugins/BvhRaycast.svelte'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <BvhRaycast>
    <Scene />
  </BvhRaycast>
</Canvas>
```
