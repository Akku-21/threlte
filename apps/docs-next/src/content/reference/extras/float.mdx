This component is a port of [drei's `<Float>` component](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#float) and makes its contents float or hover.

<Example path="core/three-arcade-game" />

### Examples

#### Basic Example

```svelte title="src/pages/[id].json.ts" {3}
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { Float } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

<Float
  floatIntensity={5}
  scale={$scale}
  rotationIntensity={2}
>
  <T.Mesh>
    <T.MeshStandardMaterial color={'orange'} />
    <T.BoxGeometry args={[5, 5, 5]} />
  </T.Mesh>
</Float>
```

## Floating

`floatingRange` determines the allowed range of position trasformation, and by extension the **direction** in which the children will move. If you provide a single number tuple, like `[-0.1,0.1]` the movement will happen on y axis. Alternatively you can provide an array of three tuples to change the movement axes. For example `[[0,0],[0,0],[-0.5,0.5]]` will move children between -0.5 and 0.5 relative to the starting position on the Z axis.

## Rotation

Rotation is set by `rotationSpeed` and `rotationIntensity`. Both of them need to be different from 0 to enable rotation. Providing a `number` in either of them applies it to all three axes. You get more granual control by passing an array `[x: number, y: number, z: number]`. `rotationSpeed` is responsible for the speed of the animation and `rotationIntensity` for the angle.

`seed` is responsible for the starting state of the animations and is random by default. Setting to a fixed value to get a predictable starting result.

### Properties

```ts {1,6} {4}+ {7,8}- title="src/pages/[id].json.ts"
// floating - y axis float by default
speed?: number | [x: number, y: number, z: number] = 1
floatIntensity?: number | [x: number, y: number, z: number] = 1
floatingRange?: [number, number] | [x: [number, number],

// rotation - disabled by default
rotationIntensity?: number | [x: number, y: number, z: number] = 0
rotationSpeed?: number | [x: number, y: number, z: number] = 0

// seed
seed?: number = Math.random() * 10000
```
