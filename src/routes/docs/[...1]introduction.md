# Introduction

Threlte is a component library for svelte to build and render three.js scenes declaratively and state-driven in Svelte apps.

<div style="height: 600px;">
  <Introduction />
</div>

It's inspired by the sensible defaults of [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), the simplicity and effectiveness of Sveltes reactivity model and [Svelte Cubed](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/svelte-cubed).

It provides strictly typed components to quickly and easily build three.js scenes with deep reactivity and interactivity out-of-the-box.

It also aims to provide the building blocks to quickly extend Threlte when it's needed.

:::admonition type="info"
Threlte is still in development and you should expect breaking changes. Check the release notes before updating. If you want to be on the safe side, install Threlte with `npm i threlte three --save-exact` to lock the versions.
