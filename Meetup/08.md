# Contribute to Threlte 🙏

- A branch with v5 refactorings of `@threlte/extras` and `@threlte/rapier` will be created in the coming days.
- A template of how a v5-compatible abstracted component can look like will come in the coming days. Until then, use the component `<Grid>` from extras as a template.
- Ask on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EqUBCfCaGm) if you need guidance on where to start.
