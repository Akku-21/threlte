## Pierced Props Notation

- Dot-notation (current) vs. dash-notation (r3f, svelte2tsx)

```html
<!-- Dot Notation -->
<T.Mesh position.x="{5}" />

<!-- Dash Notation -->
<T.Mesh position-x="{5}" />
```

- Svelte is internally using svelte2tsx to provide TypeScript language features on Svelte Components. JSX can't handle dots in prop names, that's why r3f is using this syntax for pierced props: `<mesh position-x={5} />`.
- Only seems to be a problem with `svelte-check`
- Dot-notation is more consistent with JS
