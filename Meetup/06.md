# Migration Timeline

- Rewriting components from `@threlte/extras` and `@threlte/rapier` to use `<Three>`/`<T>` instead of wrapped components.
- Because of the amorphic nature of `<Three>`/`<T>` the docs need to be structured differently. For example: Instead of
  **"These are the props"**
  it needs to be
  **"How to use component props to modify the three.js object that this component represents"**
- Any help is welcome! We need more examples!
